# Who's That Grocery Store!?
### A Canadian Grocery Store Ownership App

This application is designed to help Canadians identify the ownership of various grocery stores across the country. Given the oligopolistic nature of the Canadian grocery industry, this app aims to provide transparency and awareness about who owns what.

## Features

- Search for a grocery store to see who owns it
- View a list of grocery stores owned by a particular company
- Color-coded results for easy identification

## Getting Started

- run `npm i` to install dependencies
